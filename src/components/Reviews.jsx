    title: 'The best prop so far, FT9JA',
    body: `Ft9ja our home based Prop is really a dream come true. The amazing offers they provide for Nigerian
    traders especially synthetic indices traders is amazingly wow. Affordable purchase fees, refund
    available, 2nd chance account should in case you lose your first account. Getting paid for passing
    the evaluation which is only just one phase. I mean Ft9ja is really great and I know they would attain
    more heights in the coming years. Cheers to ft9ja and Nigerian traders. This is a big blessing to us
    here. Ft9ja all the way`,

My advice to traders read the rules if you do not understand ask Mr bassey, trust me he will put you through.`,

    Their talent bonus and Profit split withdrawals are well processed and very promptly.

    Yes! I’ll highly recommend FT9ja to all traders who are serious about their trading but need a funded account.`,

    body: `FT9ja is by far the best prop firm I have ever used. Their rules are so clear and easy. I would
    recommend FT9ja to as many Traders as I can any day any time! Honestly, the only time anyone
    would have issues with FT9ja is if you don’t read the rules.
    More Traders really need to know about FT9ja. I mean, which other prop firm gives you a second
    chance account when you violate a rule? no time limit to pass the evaluation? or even the ability to
    trade volatility indices? None! If you are an excellent Trader, trading with Ft9ja should be a walk in
    the park`,

    questions any my trading performance. Bassey answered my chat request. his responses were quick
    and clear and he took his time. I can tell he is a really hard worker guy and I wish every other prop

    but Ft9ja’s service is innovative, flexible, and more suitable for Naija Traders. Trust me, they are
    going blow soon. The only issue is their customer service; they don’t respond on time on weekends.
    Enjoying trading for them currently, prompt payments…would recommend them anytime and any
